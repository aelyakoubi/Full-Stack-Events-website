``` still need to finish the docker container ```


The .env file is included for testing! and I was not strict on the usage of Camel case methode / naming files.

- The integration test still need to be modified for this project due many changes. 


EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password    // not yet implementend in the .env file. You can add your own for testing. 


``` For now this project is done after the docker setup. An admin panel would be nice and more options etc. but because it was only for training and i will not needed.  My next project an 'online-shopping website' will have more features! ```
