UNDER CONSTRUCTION 

Development & Production  Ready

https://website-frontend-8wnm.onrender.com

It may take up to 50 till 160 seconds for the website to be online due to a free account at Render!

Het kan tot 50 seconden duren voordat de website online is i.v.m. een gratis account!

If you want to test, log in: 

Username:       ignacio_doe2

Password:       A_2622

Note: Do NOT press on delete the account otherwise you need another  username and password. 

You can find other usernames and passwords in my github account under website-backend/src/data/users.json.

Due it is connected to Render.com and my MySql server.


```Starting up !!!```

```The .env file is included for testing!```
``` The integration test still need to be modified for this project due many changes.```
```EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com```
```EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password    // You can add your own for testing if you download the website!```





``` For now this project is done after the docker setup. An admin panel would be nice and more options etc. but because it was only for training and i will not needed.  My next project an 'online-shopping website' will have more features! ```
