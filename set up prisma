** For setup/and database view **

npm install  
npm run dev
npm i prisma -D
npx prisma init
npx prisma generate
npx prisma format
npm install @prisma/client
npx prisma db push
npm run seed  
npx prisma command 

npx prisma studio (open an third terminal to view the database. npx prisma studioand enter)
npm run dev
npx prisma migrate dev --name init


To solve this issue, you can restart the server, and it will use the original dataset again. 
The test requires the original data from the seed file to work properly. 
If you want to reset your data, you can use the following command 
(keep in mind that this also pushes your latest Prisma schema):

npx prisma db push --force-reset 
npm run seed
npm run dev
